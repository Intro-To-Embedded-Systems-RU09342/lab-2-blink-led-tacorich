By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
* Initialize the WDT and Clock on the microcontroller
* Initialize and Control the GPIO on all development boards
* Blink the LED's on board the Development platforms
* Blink LED's external to the development boards
* Control the status of an LED from a Button using Polling


## Order of Exercises
1. Simple Blink
Using the provided code from ti the led is toggled every so many delay cycles.

2. Multiple Blink
The previous lab was done but with multiple LEDs at diffrent speeds


3. Button Blink
